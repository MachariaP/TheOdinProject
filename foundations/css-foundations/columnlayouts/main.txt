<h2>The Rise of Retro Gaming</h2>
<p>Retro video games hold a special place in our hearts, taking us back to the days of 8-bit graphics and chiptune soundtracks. It all kicked off in the 1970s with arcade machines like Pong, sparking a revolution that brought gaming into homes worldwide.</p>
<p>By the 1980s, consoles like the Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) turned living rooms into digital playgrounds. These systems weren’t just toys—they shaped a generation of players and developers alike.</p>
<p>The 1990s upped the ante with 16-bit powerhouses like the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. Games got faster, stories got deeper, and rivalries—like Mario vs. Sonic—became legendary. Retro gaming wasn’t just a fad; it laid the foundation for today’s industry.</p>
<h3>Tech That Started It All</h3>
<p>Early hardware was simple but groundbreaking. The Atari 2600 used a 1.19 MHz processor and 128 bytes of RAM—tiny by today’s standards, but enough to run classics like Space Invaders. Developers squeezed magic out of every byte.</p>
<h3>Why We Still Love It</h3>
<p>Nostalgia drives retro gaming’s comeback. Titles like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong feel timeless, their simple mechanics a refreshing break from modern complexity. Collectors hunt cartridges, emulators keep the classics alive, and indie devs craft new games with that old-school vibe. It’s more than pixels—it’s a culture that endures.</p>
