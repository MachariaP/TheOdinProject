  <h1>The Surprising Origins of Coffee</h1>
  <p>Coffee is more than just a morning pick-me-up—it’s a drink with a wild history. Legend says it started in Ethiopia around the 9th century with a goatherd named Kaldi. His goats got frisky after eating red coffee cherries, sparking a caffeine craze that’s lasted centuries.</p>

  <h2>NOTE</h2>
<p class="note">Coffee’s journey wasn’t always smooth. It faced bans in the 16th century—some called it the “devil’s drink” for its stimulating effects. Yet, it won over kings and commoners alike, spreading from Africa to Europe and beyond. Today, it’s the world’s most traded commodity after oil.</p>

<h2>Who Knew Coffee Had Such Roots?</h2>
  <p>From Ethiopia, coffee hit the Arabian Peninsula by the 15th century, becoming a staple in trade hubs like Mocha. Monks sipped it to stay awake during prayers, and soon it fueled global exploration. By the 1700s, plantations sprouted in the Americas, powered by colonial ambition.</p>
<h2>Not Me!</h2>
<p>I had no idea coffee shaped economies and cultures so deeply. In Brazil, it drove the slave trade—by 1850, the country produced half the world’s supply. Meanwhile, European coffeehouses became hotbeds for ideas, sparking revolutions and art movements. It’s wild how a bean changed history.</p>
  <h2>Me Neither!</h2>
  <p>The science behind coffee’s buzz is just as fascinating. That jittery kick comes from caffeine blocking adenosine in your brain, keeping you alert. Farmers perfected growing techniques over centuries, from shade-grown beans in Ethiopia to high-altitude harvests in Colombia. Now, baristas craft it into art.</p>
