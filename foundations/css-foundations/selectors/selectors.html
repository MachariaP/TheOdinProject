<h1>The Secret Life of Superheroes</h1>
<p>Ever wondered what your favorite superheroes do when they’re not saving the world? Spoiler alert: it’s not all capes and epic battles. From baking disasters to awkward gym sessions, these heroes have lives just as chaotic as ours—except with more superpowers and spandex.</p>
<p>Take Spider-Man, for example. When he’s not swinging between skyscrapers, he’s trying to perfect his web-slinging recipe for Aunt May’s famous wheatcakes. Or consider Wonder Woman—she’s secretly a pro at karaoke, belting out warrior anthems with a lasso-mic. These quirky habits make them more relatable, don’t they? Let’s dive into the hilarious and unexpected side of superhero downtime.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Even Batman has a soft spot—he collects vintage bat-themed coffee mugs!</p>
<h2>Who Knew Superheroes Had Hobbies?</h2>
<p>Turns out, superheroes aren’t all about brooding on rooftops or punching villains. The Hulk, for instance, has a surprising knack for gardening—though he keeps accidentally smashing his prize roses. Meanwhile, Black Widow spends her free time mastering origami, folding tiny paper cranes with deadly precision. These hobbies might not save the world, but they sure keep things interesting.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Thor once tried knitting a scarf with his hammer—results were... electrifying.</p>
<h3>Not Me!</h3>
<p>I never pictured Iron Man as a foodie, but Tony Stark’s been spotted tinkering with a high-tech pizza oven in his lab. Pepper Potts swears he’s burned more dough than he’s baked, but he claims it’s “research” for a suit-powered delivery service. Who knew genius billionaires could be so bad at cooking?</p>
<h3>Me Neither!</h3>
<p>And then there’s Captain America. You’d think he’d be all about vintage vibes, but he’s secretly obsessed with modern video games. Picture Cap in his star-spangled sweats, yelling at the screen during a Fortnite match. Rumor has it he once rage-quit after losing to a 12-year-old from Brooklyn.</p>
