    <h3>Beyond the Controller</h3>
    <p>Video game characters are more than just pixels on a screen—they’ve got skills you’d never expect. Take Mario, who’s not just jumping on Goombas but fixing pipes like a pro. <em>What about Lara Croft? She’s raiding tombs and uncovering ancient secrets with a knack for archaeology.</em> These hidden talents make them legends in and out of the game world. Who knew digital heroes could multitask like this?</p>
    <h3>Leveling Up in Real Life</h3>
    <p>Sonic isn’t just fast on his feet—he’s whipping up chili dogs in record time, proving speed isn’t just for running. <strong>Then there’s Link, who can juggle swords while saving Hyrule, a talent that’s as impressive as it is dangerous.</strong> From Pac-Man tending a maze-shaped garden to Kratos teaching anger management (with mixed results), these characters show there’s more to them than meets the eye. Game over? Not quite—they’re just getting started.</p>
